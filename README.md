## Goals of GoFrame
GoFrame has started as the brain child of two Australian Go developers. As students of Software Engineering and Computer Science, we want to see Golang take its place at the forefront of computing. The days of Global Interpreter Locks are over. The age of the GoFrame has begun. GoFrame aims to:

- Imitate and reproduce Dataframe datastrucutres in Golang
- Provide an intuitive method for working with labelled or relational data in Go
- Give traditional data analytics tools in Python and R a run for their money in a faster and more scalable language
