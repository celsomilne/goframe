Series
------------------------------------
------------------------------------

Properties
__________

- index - ascending order index of elements
- indexing - get value at a certain index
- NaN - null values

Methods
_______

- abs
- all - return whether all values in the series are true
- append - concatenate two or more series
- apply - apply a function to each value in the series
- where - get all values which fill a condition
    - geq, ge, leq, le, eq - all will need to be called from where. Elementwise comparisons.
    -  ^    ^   ^    ^   ^
      >=    >  <=    <   ==
    - nonzero - return true where values are non zero
- copy - return a copied series
- count - return the number of non Nan values
- cummax, cummin, cumsum, cumprod - return a series containing the cumulative values. See pandas for explaination
- diff - difference between each element and its subsequent element
- dot - dot product of two series
- hist - histogram of the series
- shift - shift all values down or up in index by some value
- mean
- median
- std
- var
- percentile - find percentiles of the data
- rolling - find rolling window calculations
- to_csv
- to_excel
- to_sql ** VERY HARD
- unique - all unique values in the series
- nunique - number of unique values in the series
- plotting ** VERY HARD

Testing
_______
- Each test should show that the dataframe has not been modified from the original one, if necessary.

Notes
_____

We will also have to implement threading for many of these methods when data gets too big. Definitely something for later in the pipeline...
